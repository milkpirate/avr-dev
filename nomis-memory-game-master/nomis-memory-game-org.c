 * Memory Game is a Simon (tm) clone based around an ATTiny85 microprocessor.
 * The game generates a "random" string of moves for the player to copy.
 * If the player is unable to remember the string and presses a wrong button,
 * then the game is over and the player looses.
 *
 * The random numbers are generated using a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG),
 * which functions based on the formula X_next = (a*X_n + c) mod m. The 
 * selection of a, c and m are very important for generating a series of
 * psuedo-random numbers with the maximum period of m. Selection is outlined
 * inside of the rand_lcg() function

 *         
 * IDLE: The MCU waits for an input from the user to play the game. In this state
 *       the MCU cascades the LEDS, signifying that it is on and ready to go. While
 *       this is happening the MCU is incrementing the random variable to
 *       continuously change the seed. Exits into the CPU state if a button is
 *       pressed.
 *
 * CPU: The CPU's turn. The CPU (well MCU) generates a random number and,
 *        adds that as a move to the moves[] array. Then the CPU returns the game
 *        to the PLAYER state. Ignores input from player.
 * 
 * PLAYER: The player's turn, in this state the MCU will wait for a string of 
 *           inputs from the player. Once the Player presses a button that is not
 *           in the array moves[], the player looses the game and the game goes to
 *           the LOSE state. Otherwise the game goes to the CPU state and the 
 *           computer adds another move to the moves array.
 *
 * LOSE: Cleans up the game and returns to the IDLE state. Just for house keeping.
