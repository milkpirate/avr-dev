;;; USI I2C for Atmel 25 and larger chips.

;;; Features: Uniform frequency (9 cycles high, 14 cycles low) for SCK except
;;; for STOP condition where it is 15 cycles low.

;;; Input: Pointer to unsigned character buffer (in R24:25).
;;; Returns any read data into same buffer.
;;; Buffer format: One or more of: { LEN ADDR-RW BYTES }, followed by zero
;;; LEN is the number of bytes for the transfer, the address-r/w plus any
;;; bytes read or written.  A start condition is generated, the address is
;;; sent, then bytes are read or written.  If there is another transfer, a
;;; repeated start is generated, and the second transfer occurs.  Otherwise
;;; a stop condition is generated.

;;; The USI on the ATtinyx5 uses PB0 and PB2 which are properly set upon start.

;;; Constants
        
ZERO = 1
PORTB = 0x18
DDRB = 0x17
PINB = 0x16
USIDR = 0x0f

;;; PulseSCL - generate the high-time for SCL during data bit transfers.  Start and
;;; Stop are handled separately.  Timing adjusted for minimum of 6 cycles, but normal
;;; pullups will do 9 cycles since the test to wait for the line to actually go high
;;; is just after the line is released so reads as 0 at the instant.
